- Definitions
    - **Git** - a version control system which monitors changes to files
    - **The repository** - collection of files and folders managed by Git -- *aim to keep these narrow in topic e.g. Data Analytics / Science*
    - **Local repository** - a repository that resides on a computer
    - **Remote repository** - versions of your repository that are hosted on the Internet or network somewhere
    - **Working directory** - the directory with your source files under git control (in the root of all dirs under control . git file is present). Git is tracking the difference between your working directory and local repository, and between your local repository and (one of) remote repositories.
    - **GitHub** - a provider of internet hosting for Git repositories
    - **Branch** - A version of the repository that diverges from the main working project. Branches can be a new version of a repository, experimental changes, or personal forks of a repository for users to alter and test changes.

Working directory / Workspace (root folder of a repo will contain a .git folder which is the actual repo)

Commits and Files

- Git works by saving snapshots of the contents of its files, these are called commits
- Commits are saved onto a timeline called a branch. Called master by default. A repository may have many branches.

Core Concepts

- GitHub is a git repository hosting service
- Unlimited free public repositories

Command line

- git version (if it returns a version, git is installed)
- git config --global [user.name](http://user.name/) "your name"
- git config --global user.email "[your@email.com](mailto:your@email.com)"
- pwd - print working directory
- ls - list the directories in this location "ls -al" includes hidden folder
- mkdir - make a new directory
- git init "demo" - initialising an empty git repo
- git status (tells us what the crack is)

Git local "states"

1. Working directory - contains all files and folders
2. Staging area - used to prepare for the next commit. Moved to modified working directory to staging to be moved to the repository
3. Repository (.git folder) - all the commited or saved changes to the repository (Git's history)

Also downloading a text editor *** look up

command line - navigate to the directory 'projects'

The below sets VS Code as the default text editor then uses code to create a [README.md](http://readme.md/) in the wd

- git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
Also needed to open VScode and (Cmd + Shift + P) and type 'shell command' to find the 'Shell command: install 'code' command in PATH'
- git config --global -e
- code [README.md](http://readme.md/)
- save file, git status
- git add is used to stage changes - there is git add [FILE.md](http://file.md/), git add -A (all changes), git add . (all in this folder) and git add -U (distinction as yet unknown)
- git commit -m "First file in demo repo"
- "clear" moves all of the commands up

Inner workings of the git repository

- When I am in the /projects/demo folder is the working directory of the repository. The actual git repository is contained within the git folder itself
- rm -rf .git (removes the file - no longer in a git repository because the .git file is removed). Git status says "not a git repository"
- If we then use "git init" initialises an empty Git repository in the current directory
- using git commit in the vs code terminal is the same as using it in the terminal. When you execute git commit, it will prompt you for a commit message
- git log (will show a list of all of the commits)
- git show will list all the commits with more detail (use q to get out of this

Express commits

CLEAN UP ABOVE

## The basics

### Creating a file

The keyword for VS Code to create files is "code". The following code will open the text editor (in this case VS code). 

```objectivec
code README.md
```

The file is currently blank and so will need to be populated with some text or changes followed by command + S to save it. The white dot next to .md will disappear when this file has been saved to the branch you are working on.

![Screenshot 2021-10-27 at 08.55.37.png](GitHub%203a81926a5cf94b4e989da95932a8b981/Screenshot_2021-10-27_at_08.55.37.png)

```objectivec
git status
```

git status displays the untracked or staged files that have not yet been committed.

![Screenshot 2021-10-27 at 08.51.18.png](GitHub%203a81926a5cf94b4e989da95932a8b981/Screenshot_2021-10-27_at_08.51.18.png)

This file is currently **untracked** and needs to be add it to **staging** so that we can commit it.

### Staging a file using <git add>

```objectivec
git add README
git status
```

The command <git add .> can also be used with the '.' in meaning add all files in staging.

![Screenshot 2021-11-02 at 08.19.44.png](GitHub%203a81926a5cf94b4e989da95932a8b981/Screenshot_2021-11-02_at_08.19.44.png)

There are now changes on this branch to be committed. The command line also displays how to un-stage this file using <git restore - - staged file>

### Committing a file using <git commit>

The < -m > allows a message to be included for this commit.

```objectivec
git commit -m "message for commit"
```

The command line displays that for the commit named "First file" there is 1 file changed and 1 insertion added to this file (the one line of text "Hello world!" is considered the insertion)

![Screenshot 2021-11-02 at 08.25.00.png](GitHub%203a81926a5cf94b4e989da95932a8b981/Screenshot_2021-11-02_at_08.25.00.png)

### Repository and Git folder: the inner workings of the Git repository

The 'demo' folder is the working directory of the Git repository. The actual repository is in the .git/ directory.

![Screenshot 2021-11-02 at 08.33.24.png](GitHub%203a81926a5cf94b4e989da95932a8b981/Screenshot_2021-11-02_at_08.33.24.png)

```objectivec
ls -al
cd .git/
```

![Screenshot 2021-11-02 at 08.34.58.png](GitHub%203a81926a5cf94b4e989da95932a8b981/Screenshot_2021-11-02_at_08.34.58.png)

If the .git folder is removed, the demo directory will no longer respond to git commands as demo will no longer be in a git repository.

```objectivec
rm -rf .git
git init .
```

The first command deletes the .git folder and leaves 'demo' a non-version controlled directory. The second initialises an empty git repository in the .git folder

Applying <git status> to the newly initialised repository, will prompt the response that the files in the working directory are untracked as the new .git folder has no knowledge of previous commits.

### Commit details with log and show

To display all of the commits that are part of this repository, git shows 

```objectivec
git log
```

![Screenshot 2021-11-02 at 08.47.44.png](GitHub%203a81926a5cf94b4e989da95932a8b981/Screenshot_2021-11-02_at_08.47.44.png)

Here we have: the commit IDs, the authors, the date and time of the commits and the name of the files committed and the messages in the text editor. 

The git show command shows the same but all of the changes in the file. Use q to get out of the git show.

```objectivec
git show
q
```

![Screenshot 2021-11-08 at 08.31.50.png](GitHub%203a81926a5cf94b4e989da95932a8b981/Screenshot_2021-11-08_at_08.31.50.png)

### Express commit

The express commit relies on files being tracked by git. These are files which have already been committed and are being modified or files that have been staged. They are files that git knows about.

If we open the [README.md](http://README.md) and make changes to it, save and close, these modifications are being tracked but unstaged.

```objectivec
code README.md      
git status
```

![Screenshot 2021-11-08 at 08.52.55.png](GitHub%203a81926a5cf94b4e989da95932a8b981/Screenshot_2021-11-08_at_08.52.55.png)

The next command returns all of the files that git is tracking. To check this, if we create a new file, we can use the ls command and the git ls-files command to see that the new file is in the working directory, but it is not being tracked by git.

```objectivec
git ls-files        *shows files being tracked by git
touch new.file      *creates a new file
ls
git status
rm new.file         *removes file
```

An 'express commit' relies on the files being tracked by git and simply adds the modifications to the staging area and commits them automatically

```objectivec
git commit -am "Updating README"
git log 
git show
```

Git commit -a is the express commit but we can add the message in the command line by adding m

In a nutshell: 

**Untracked** changes are **not in Git.** 

**Unstaged** changes are **in Git** but **not marked for commit**. 

**Staged** changes are **in Git and** marked for **commit**.

### File status lifecycle

![Screenshot 2021-11-09 at 08.30.57.png](GitHub%203a81926a5cf94b4e989da95932a8b981/Screenshot_2021-11-09_at_08.30.57.png)

### Backing out

Below is the two step process for removing the file from staging (before it has been committed) and reverting to the last version of the file known by git.

To unstage the file after you use git add, enter git status and then follow the instructions in the prompt.

```objectivec
git status
git restore --staged README.md
```

The file will still have the changes ready to be staged. To revert back to the last known file enter git status and then follow the instructions in the prompt.

```objectivec
git status 
git restore README.md
```

![Screenshot 2021-11-09 at 08.43.42.png](GitHub%203a81926a5cf94b4e989da95932a8b981/Screenshot_2021-11-09_at_08.43.42.png)

### Playing around with git logs

The below returns one line for each of the commits that we have done.

```objectivec
git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all
```

![Screenshot 2021-11-09 at 08.47.22.png](GitHub%203a81926a5cf94b4e989da95932a8b981/Screenshot_2021-11-09_at_08.47.22.png)

### Rename and Delete Files

Changing the name - mv means moving the file

```objectivec
git mv example.txt demo.txt
```

![Screenshot 2021-11-09 at 08.57.10.png](GitHub%203a81926a5cf94b4e989da95932a8b981/Screenshot_2021-11-09_at_08.57.10.png)

Note that git says that it is 100% confident that the example.txt file is identical to the demo.txt file. 

If we had made some changes to the demo.txt file prior to committing, then that level would be lower than 100%.

Removing the file using git rather than just deleting it has the added benefit of the deletions being tracked by git. Use the build in rm function to stage the deletions and then commit them using git commit.

```objectivec
git rm demo.txt
git status
git commit -m "deleting demo file"
```

### Excluding files and folders from repo

There is an option to exclude files from any future commits. Might want to do this for log files for an application.

Gitignore will prompt the text editor to open. We can then enter 1 line per file we want to exclude from Git's version control by specifying 1 file per line in the text editor. 

Equally, we can exclude all files of a certain type using *.log (excludes all log files).

The .gitignore file is still a file 

```jsx
.gitignore
git add
git commit -m "adding ignore file"
```

## Advanced: beyond the basics

### Topics include (local level):

- Compare differences
- Branch, merge and resolve conflicts
- How to tag milestones in git
- How to time travel

### Tracking differences

```jsx
mate README.md
git status 
git diff 
git difftool
q - quit
```

Whilst git status shows us we have a modified file that is not yet staged, we don't know what those changes are until we hit git diff. The difftool command makes this much more readable.

### Branching and Merge types

A branch = a timeline of commits. Specifically, branch names are just labels we give timelines.

Merge types depend on what has happened on the feature branch and on the master branch in between creation and merge 

- Fast-forward merge:
    - Simplest case
    - No additional work has been detected on the parent branch (master, in this case)
    - Git applies all commit
    - We can disable fast forward merges if undesirable for some reason
        
        ![Screenshot 2021-11-23 at 08.57.03.png](GitHub%203a81926a5cf94b4e989da95932a8b981/Screenshot_2021-11-23_at_08.57.03.png)
        
- Automatic merge:
    - Git detects non-conflicting changes in the master branch and automatically resolves any conflicts
    - Old branches timeline is preserved and a new merge commit is created to show the merging of the two branches
        
        ![Screenshot 2021-11-23 at 08.58.30.png](GitHub%203a81926a5cf94b4e989da95932a8b981/Screenshot_2021-11-23_at_08.58.30.png)
        
- Manual merge:
    - When git is unable to automatically solve any conflicting merges
    - Conflicting merge state - all merge conflicts must be resolved prior to moving forward with the commit
    - Once all conflict are resolved, those changes are saved as a merge commit

### Special Markers

- HEAD - is normally the last commit of the current branch. As we switch branches, the location of HEAD moves to match the last location of that branch.

### Branches

- Create and manage a branch. Git branch tells me the
- The modifications from the master branch will be taken forward to the new branch when you create it

```objectivec
git branch 
git checkout -b updates
```

![Screenshot 2021-11-25 at 08.39.40.png](GitHub%203a81926a5cf94b4e989da95932a8b981/Screenshot_2021-11-25_at_08.39.40.png)

- Git diff command will allow us to pass in the names of branches rather than commit IDs.

```objectivec
git diff updates master
```

In order to integrate any changes on my branch, I need to first switch onto my parent branch (master).

```objectivec
git checkout master
git merge updates (merges branch)
git branch -d updates (deletes updates)
git branch -a (shows all branches)
```

Deleting the branch once it has merged as the updates is just the label for the branch. The changes in updates have been integrated to the master branch.

NOTE: this is only using Git and not the GitHub interface.

### Conflict Resolution

Updating the same part of the file on both branches will cause a conflict.

```objectivec
cat README.md (outputs the contents of that file)
git mergetool (opens a merging tool)
```

![Screenshot 2021-11-25 at 08.51.56.png](GitHub%203a81926a5cf94b4e989da95932a8b981/Screenshot_2021-11-25_at_08.51.56.png)

![Screenshot 2021-11-25 at 08.53.33.png](GitHub%203a81926a5cf94b4e989da95932a8b981/Screenshot_2021-11-25_at_08.53.33.png)

- Choose the version we want to use and save it
- CMD + q to quit p4 merge (the default merging tool)
- Commit the new file

### Tags

Labels that you can put at any arbitrary commit point to mark the progress at that point.

There are two types of tags:

- Lightweight tags - named at the default position

```objectivec
git hist
git tag mytag
git tag --list
git tag -d mytag
```

- Annotated tags (prefer these). This is different from lightweight when we use git show

```objectivec
git tag -a v1.0 -m "Release 1.0"
git tag --list
git show v1.0
```

### Stashing

When we decide that we really should have made a modification on a branch or maybe we need to change context and work on something else for a while

```objectivec
git stash 
git status
git stash pop
```

Git stash saves where you were. The git stash pop does two things at once: apply and drop. Apply applies the last stash (changes) and then drop the stash (meaning that stash is no longer about).

### Time Travel with Reset and Reflog

There may be times that you need to go to a different commit point. If you make a mistake or want to role back to a previous commit.

```objectivec
git hist 
git reset commitID --soft
git reset commitID --mixed
git reset commitID --hard
```

3 ways of resetting

- Soft - least destructive, it changes where HEAD is pointing to (it preserves the git staging area)
- Mixed (default) - can unstage files as well
- Hard - this will

Git log shows all our commit IDs but git reflog shows use all of the actions we have taken in the git repository (including resets). This allows us to reset to a commit ID before any of the above resets.

```objectivec
git reflog
git reset --hard commitID
git log --oneline
```

## Welcome to GitHub

So far, we have only been working on our local machine.

Create new repository and description (make it public). We then link the GitHub repository and link it to our remote repository.

### Linking Git repo to GitHub

The following instructions are for situations where you have used 'git init' to create the repository on your local machine and you are trying to push.

![Screenshot 2021-12-17 at 16.59.24.png](GitHub%203a81926a5cf94b4e989da95932a8b981/Screenshot_2021-12-17_at_16.59.24.png)

git remote -v shows use the repositories that we have remotely connected

```objectivec
git remote -v      
git remote add origin URL
git push -u origin master --tags
```

In this case, the URL is in the screenshot above.
